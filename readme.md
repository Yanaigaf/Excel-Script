# Average wage fetcher
This a script I wrote to automate a certain process of my work.
The script accesses cbs.gov.il (Israeli central bureau of statistics) and gets all wage statistics publications for the requested years and months. It will then read the files to find the most recent average wage available at the date of the publication, and save all results to a file named results.xlsx.
